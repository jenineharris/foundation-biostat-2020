### III. BROWN SCHOOL ACADEMIC POLICIES

#### Academic Integrity  
If a faculty member or student suspects that academic or professional integrity has been violated, they are required to submit an Academic Integrity or Professional Integrity Violation form found on Inside Brown for review by the Assistant Dean of the program.  The Assistant Dean or designated representative will aid in the investigation of the violation, which includes but is not limited to gathering relevant evidence; conversations with the instructor, student(s) involved, witnesses, and others as necessary. Depending on the seriousness of the case, the Assistant Dean may choose to refer the matter directly to the University Student Conduct Board. This referral procedure will generally be followed if it is believed that the penalty is likely to involve suspension or expulsion from the University. The Assistant Dean for the program or designated representative will offer to meet privately with the student(s) against whom the complaint has been made.  It is the student's responsibility to familiarize themselves with the behaviors that constitute an academic integrity violation requiring referral.

[Student Handbook 2020](https://insidebrown.wustl.edu/People/students/studenthandbook/Pages/default.aspx)

#### Accommodations
If you have a learning disability, sensory, or physical disability or other impairment, and you may need special assistance in lectures, reading, written assignments, and/or exam taking, please contact the Brown School Director of Student Affairs who can provide coordination of accommodations at Washington University and the Brown School. The [Disability Resource Center](https://students.wustl.edu/disability-resources/), a University-wide resource, provides diagnostic and academic accommodations support and referrals.

#### English Language Proficiency 
If your English language proficiency is such that you may need special assistance in lectures, reading, written assignments, and/or exam taking, please communicate these needs to your instructor who may refer you to the [English Language Program (ELP)](http://oiss.wustl.edu/english-language-programs/).  ELP is a University-wide resource that provides classes and academic English language support designed to increase non-native English speaking students' English language proficiency and to facilitate their academic success at Washington University.  You may also find the Academic Assistance resources available through the [Office for International Students and Scholars](http://oisshome.wustl.edu/students/) to be helpful.

#### Professional Use of Electronic Devices in the Classroom
Computers or other electronic devices, including "smart pens" (devices with an embedded computer and digital audio recorder that records the classroom lecture/discussion and links that recording to the notes taken by the student), may be used by students at the discretion of the faculty member to support the learning activities in the classroom. These activities include taking notes and accessing course readings under discussion. If a student wishes to use a smart-pen or other electronic device to audio record lectures or class discussions, they must notify the instructor in advance of doing so. Permission to use recording devices is at the discretion of the instructor, unless this use is an accommodation approved by Disability Resources. 

Nonacademic use of laptops and other devices and use of laptops or other devices for other coursework is distracting and seriously disrupts the learning process for other people in the classroom. Neither computers nor other electronic devices are to be used in the classroom during class for nonacademic reasons or for work on other coursework. Nonacademic use includes emailing, texting, social networking, playing games, instant messaging, and use of the Internet. Work on other coursework may include, but is not limited to, use of the Internet, writing papers, using statistical software, analyzing data, and working on quizzes or exams. The nonacademic use of cell phones during class time is prohibited, and they should be set on silent before class begins. In the case of an emergency, please step out of the room to take the call. The instructor has the right to hold students accountable for meeting these expectations, and failure to do so may result in a loss of participation or attendance points, a loss of the privilege of device use in the classroom, or being asked to leave the classroom.

#### Religious Holidays
The Brown School recognizes the individual student's choice in observing religious holidays that occur during periods when classes are scheduled. Students are encouraged to arrange with their instructors to make up work missed as a result of religious observance, and instructors are asked to make every reasonable effort to accommodate such requests.

### IV. 	WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY ACADEMIC SUPPORT POLICIES

#### Accommodations based upon sexual assault

Accommodations based upon relationship or sexual violence, including sexual harassment and stalking: The University is committed to offering reasonable accommodations to students who are victims of relationship or sexual violence.  Students are eligible for accommodations regardless of whether they seek criminal or disciplinary action.  Depending on the specific nature of the allegation, such accommodations may include but are not limited to implementation of a no-contact order, emergency housing, course/classroom assignment changes, assignment extensions and other academic support services.  If you need to request such accommodations, please direct your requests to [rsvpcenter@wustl.edu](rsvpcenter@wustl.edu) or call directly to 314-935-3445. 

There are licensed RSVP counselors who serve as confidential resources. However, to implement requests for accommodations, limited information will be shared with the appropriate university administrator and/or faculty.  The University will maintain as confidential any accommodations or protective measures provided to an individual student so long as it does not impair the ability to provide such measures.

If a student comes to me to discuss or disclose an instance of sexual assault, sex discrimination, sexual harassment, dating violence, domestic violence or stalking, or if I otherwise observe or become aware of such an allegation, I will keep the information as private as I can, but as a faculty member of Washington University, I am required to immediately report it to my Associate, Assistant or School Dean or directly to Ms. Jessica Kennedy, the University’s Title IX Director.  If you would like to speak with directly Ms. Kennedy directly, she can be reached at (314) 935-3118, or via email at [jwkennedy@wustl.edu](jwkennedy@wustl.edu).  Additionally, you can report incidents or complaints to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards or by contacting WUPD at (314) 935-5555 or your local law enforcement agency. See: [https://titleix.wustl.edu](Title IX)

You can also speak confidentially and learn more about available resources at the Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention Center by calling (314) 935-3445 for an appointment  See: [RSVP Center](https://students.wustl.edu/relationship-sexual-violence-prevention-center/)

**Bias Reporting**

The University has a process through which students, faculty, staff and community members who have experienced or witnessed incidents of bias, prejudice or discrimination against a student can report their experiences to the University’s Bias Report and Support System (BRSS) team.  See: [brss.wustl.edu](brss.wustl.edu).  

**Mental Health**

Mental Health Services’ professional staff members work with students to resolve personal and interpersonal difficulties, many of which can affect the academic experience. These include conflicts with or worry about friends or family, concerns about eating or drinking patterns, and feelings of anxiety and depression.  See [Mental Health Resources](https://insidebrown.wustl.edu/People/students/Pages/Mental-Health-Resources.aspx) to be connected with a provider at Habif Health & Wellness, or in the Community

**Center for Diversity and Inclusion (CDI)** 

The Center of Diversity and Inclusion (CDI) supports and advocates for undergraduate, graduate, and professional school students from underrepresented and/or marginalized populations, creates collaborative partnerships with campus and community partners, and promotes dialogue and social change.  One of the CDI's strategic priorities is to cultivate and foster a supportive campus climate for students of all backgrounds, cultures and identities. See: [diversityinclusion.wustl.edu/](diversityinclusion.wustl.edu/)

**Additional Issues or Concerns**  

If you feel that you need additional supports in order to be successful in your time at Brown, beyond the mentioned accommodations, please contact your Academic Advisor or [miriamjoelson@wustl.edu](Miriam Joelson), Academic and Student Affairs Coordinator. They can assist you in navigating a myriad of concerns. 

### V.	COVID-19 HEATH AND SAFETY PROTOCOLS

Exceptions to course policies, expectations, and requirements (including attendance and assignment deadlines) because of COVID-19 diagnosis, symptoms consistent with COVID-19 or exposure to a person with a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis will be made in collaboration between the student and instructor. In these cases, please notify your instructor as soon as possible to discuss appropriate accommodations.

We take your health and the health of our community seriously. Any Danforth Campus student who is currently diagnosed with COVID-19, is experiencing symptoms consistent with COVID-19, or has had direct contact with a person with a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis must remain home and isolate yourself from others. Students who have symptoms and/or do not pass the screening protocol described below must call the Habif Health and Wellness Center at 314-935-6666 for additional instructions.

All students on the Danforth Campus are required to complete the self-screening and reporting before each time that they come to campus. To complete the screening questionnaire, visit COVID-19 restrictions and screening for campus access and log in with your WUSTL Key. 

While on campus, it is imperative that students follow all public health guidelines established to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission within our community. The full set of University protocols can be found https://covid19.wustl.edu/health-safety/. This includes… 

*	Complying with physical distancing requirements at all times and adhere to signage and environmental cues. This includes not congregating before or after class as well as during breaks or class activities. 

*	Complying with universal masking. All individuals on campus must wear disposable masks or cloth face coverings while occupying indoor public settings, including: multi-person offices; hallways; stairwells; elevators; meeting rooms; classrooms;  restrooms; and when in campus outdoor spaces unless you can maintain six feet of physical distance from others.  In the event that a student cannot wear a mask due to a medical condition or other concerns, they should consult with their academic advisors. 

*	Practicing healthy personal hygiene, including frequent handwashing with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds and/or using hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.  

*	Complying with cleaning and sanitation protocols. Students may be responsible for wiping down common surfaces after use, particularly those that might be shared with others (e.g. classroom desks). Instructions for sanitizing technology equipment can be found here. 

### VI.	READINGS

There are 2 course books:

(1) Statistics with R: Solving Problems Using Real-World Data (Jenine K. Harris)
(2) Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men (Caroline Criado-Perez)

The options for obtaining free versions of the planned course book are limited by the new structures keeping us all safe in the pandemic (limited course reserves and library access), so there are now 2 options for course readings. While the main book is now *optional*, it remains highly preferred for use in the course. I have a number of options to make the for-purchase book less expensive if you want to do this option. 

*Please note that, based on my contract with the publisher, I do not expect to receive any royalties from purchases of my book for this semester and, if somehow I do unexpectedly receive royalties, I will donate them back to the Brown School for scholarships.*

Options for obtaining the course book at low or no cost: 

Least expensive: 

* Brown School library has 3 copies to loan 
* Rent print book from [Chegg](https://www.chegg.com/textbooks/statistics-with-r-1st-edition-9781506388151-1506388159?trackid=b7b8be3dea51&strackid=ff854a93b390) (cost: $32 for 6 months) 

Other options: 

* [Direct from Sage](https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/statistics-with-r/book253567): 
    + Purchase paperback directly from Sage using the "SAGE2020" coupon code (cost: $87.50) 
* Rent eBook from Amazon, RedShelf, [VitalSource](https://www.vitalsource.com/products/statistics-with-r-jenine-k-harris-v9781506388144?term=9781506388151) (cost: Approximately $55/6 months) 

**Alternate open source books:**

Alternate readings will be provided each week (except the first 4 weeks since the press has made those chapters free online). The three main alternate books are listed below. The Fischetti book has 8 WUSTL licenses so 8 people can have the electronic copy of this book open at any given time. The Dalgaard book has unlimited user access. Both can be accessed through the WUSTL library website. Someone put the whole Field book online or there may be copies to check out at the library.

### VII.	ORGANIZATION OF COURSE

This class is flipped! This means that, instead of lecturing over zoom, the lectures will be pre-recorded and assigned to watch outside of class. Then, in-class, we will use the time for hands-on activities that resemble what you might usually consider homework. Most weeks the first hour will be reserved for one-on-one appointments (sign up on Discussion Board in Canvas), the second hour will be a check-in on the work from the prior week and occasionally a demo from the reading(s)/video(s) of the week. During the last hour of each week, students will be placed in zoom rooms with a few other students and the instructor will go from room-to-room to answer questions. At the same time, the TA (Laura Brugger) will be in a separate zoom room available for one-on-one assistance (Zoom ID: 261 526 2045).

On other weeks we will have a course book club, project work time, and final project discussion and peer reviews. 

The course work is designed to introduce you to statistical approaches common in the social sciences. Most weeks you will have time to start the weekly exercises in class. In addition to the hours you spend in class each week, expect to spend 5-7 hours each week reading, reviewing course materials, and working on exercises. The total course commitment should be about 10 hours/week on average over the course of the semester. 

If you are working on coursework outside of class time and your books and other materials do not contain enough information for you to complete the work, there are multiple options for you to get help: 

* Try the R Studio community page: https://community.rstudio.com
* Check the UCLA statistics website, youtube, and other online resources 
* Email the instructor or TA 
* Go to the instructor or TA student hours 
* Make an appointment with the StatLab 
* Make a one-on-one appointment outside student hours with the TA or instructor 

The instructor and TA will attempt to provide you with a response within 24 hours during the course, although it may be longer if you request help during the weekend. 

### VIII.	ROLE OF FACULTY AND STUDENT

The instructor will facilitate the student's learning experience through demonstrations, activities, exercises, exams, and outside consultation with students. The instructor will provide timely feedback on student performance. Students are expected to attend class on time and be prepared; complete all required readings and assignments in a timely manner; and participate actively in class. If any student has problems with attendance, meeting deadlines, or completing work on/by a given date, it is important that these difficulties be discussed promptly with the instructor.    

### IX.	COURSE OUTLINE AND GRADING

During the course you will earn points by completing individual projects and a book club discussion with a group. Five percent of your grade is also based on professionalism which includes participation in the course Discussion Board and/or the zoom room along with the group work for book club. Your book club teammates and TA will be consulted in the calculation of the professionalism grade. At the end of the course, the percent you have earned from the individual projects, book club, and professionalism will translate into a letter grade. Note that your final score is not rounded up, so you have to reach at least the percentage shown to earn the grade.

#### What will happen during scheduled class time each week:

* Individual appointments (1 hour) 
    + Only people with appointments attend this, sign up for appointments on Canvas 
    + Highly recommend at least 2 individual appointments per semester 
* Check-in/warm-up/Q&A (1 hour) 
    + zoom in to class to discuss previous exercises, ask questions
* Work time for challenges (1 hour) 
    + zoom in to class to work in a zoom room with a few others on the week's exercises
    + Dr. Harris will go from zoom room to zoom room to answer questions and help out 
    + Laura will be available for one-on-one meetings during this time at her zoom room 

#### Weighting: 

* 10% book club 
* 15% statistics in the wild 
* 5% professionalism 
* 70% midterm and final projects  

**Late work is not accepted. Specific policies:** 

*What happens if I don't submit the midterm project on time?* The item will not be graded and the percentage available for the item will be *added to the weight of your final project*. Because a small number of points (no more than 5% of points) for the final project are earned by making revisions based on feedback for the midterm, those points will only be available to you if you submit a draft of the first half of the project for informal review to Dr. Harris via email at least 2 weeks prior to the final project due date. Withough incorporating feedback, a 100% grade on the final will not be possible. 

Run the following code in R Studio `cowsay::say(what = "Do or do not. There is no try.",by = "yoda")`, try changing the saying inside the quote marks to something else and try changing "yoda" to "cat" or "cow" or another animal. Copy and post your results and code to the discussion board fun thread.
 
*What happens if I have to miss book club?* You will still be reviewed by your team for your participation in planning for book club and that will influence your professionalism score for the course. In lieu of your actual attendance at book club for the 10%, you have the option to take a score of zero or to submit a 750-1500 word paper discussing the topics from the book club night. This paper is due by the final course meeting on December 10th.

*What happens if my statistics in the wild is late?* Your score will be 0. Start early so that even if you have difficult life event(s) late in the semester you still have something to submit! 

The highest threshold you reach will be your earned grade: 
* 95% A 
* 90% A- 
* 88% B+ 
* 85% B
* 80% B- 
* 78% C+ 
* 75% C 
* 70% C- 
* 0% F 

#### Graded components of the course

**Statistics in the wild (15%)** (Due December 3)

Choose ONE of the following projects to complete ON YOUR OWN. The purpose of this project is to introduce sources of statistics information and voices in statistics outside this course. This is a very exciting and critical time for statistics, with a rapidly developing focus on bias and how the data community can work to reduce or eliminate bias in data science and artificial intelligence/machine learning. These projects are designed to take 12-16 hours total, so plan accordingly. Timing may vary based on how quickly (or slowly) you read, write, and code. Email Dr. Harris a cat (or statistics) meme by October 1st to earn 1% to add to your final project score.

(1) Choose a state senate race and make a prediction about what will happen in the November 2020 US Election based on historical data and current polls. Create a short 5-10 minute video to share with the class on the class discussion board or present your results in 10-15 minutes over zoom to the class **before the election** (if you decide to present, please let Dr. Harris know at least 1 week in advance). Include relevant statistics, tables, and graphs in your presentation/video.   

(2) Participate in an online statistics or R coding workshop and create a brief tutorial or video to teach others about something you learned at the workshop. Choosing a tutorial about data management, visualization, or bias in data science are recommended. The tutorial should be an R-Markdown file or a video (approximately 5 minute video length). Assume that your audience is the other students in your *Foundations in Public Health: Biostatistics* course. Post the video or R-Markdown file on the course discussion board. 

(3) Listen to a minimum of 5 episodes of a statistics or R related podcast and write a discussion board podcast review post of *up to 500 words*. The post should have three parts: (1) a summary of the topics in the episodes you listened to (with episode names), (2) a discussion of the relevance (or lack of relevance) of the topics to you and/or your profession, and (3) a recommendation to other students about the podcast (worth the time? not worth the time?).  

(4) Read _Rigor Mortis_ by Richard Harris or _Weapons of Math Destruction_ by Cathy O'Neil or _Factfulness_ by Hans Rosling or _Algorithms of Oppression_ by Safiya Noble and write a discussion board book review post of *no more than 500 words*. The post should have three parts: (1) a summary of the book, (2) a discussion of the relevance (or lack of relevance) of the topics in the book to you and/or your profession, and (3) a recommendation to other students about the book (worth the time? not worth the time?). 

(5) Identify a quantitative published article that uses a publicly available data set like NHANES or BRFSS, or an article you are able to obtain the data for in some other way. Reproduce a table or figure from the article as closely as you can using R. Write a very brief post on the class discussion board that about your project including any challenges you faced. Attach an R-Markdown file to the post that includes the annotated R code you used to reproduce the figure or table.

Statistics in the Wild projects will be graded as complete (100), partial (70), or incomplete/missing (0). If you feel uncomfortable posting your project to the class discussion board under your own name, remove your name from the work and send it via email to Dr. Harris and include the name of the post; Dr. Harris will post it for you confidentially. See schedule for due date and **plan ahead**!

All options meet at least one competency depending on what the student selects and their approach.

**Book club (10%)** (Held December 3)

For book club you will be assigned to a team by the topic you are most interested in and your team will be responsible for leading a class discussion or activity on the topic. The discussion or activity can be during class time, or on the Discussion Board during the week of book club. The discussion or activity should include opportunities for participation by other students in the class with clear instructions for how to participate. Please let Dr. Harris know your team preference for: (1) doing a "live" via zoom activity or discussion, or (2) doing a Discussion Board activity or discussion so she can alert your classmates. 

Additional details will become available when book club gets closer. Like Statistics in the Wild, the book club team scores will be complete (100), partial (70), or incomplete (0). Contributing to your book club team is also part of the professionalism score in class and your team will be asked to evaluate your contribution. It is possible that students in the same team will receive different scores if peer-evaluations indicate a lack of contribution by one or more team members. 

**Midterm (Due October 15) + final project (70%) (Due December 10)**

Find a data set on your own and use the data to answer a research question of your choice. If you choose one of the data sets we have used in class, the research question and variables used should be different from what we did in class. It is ok if one or two of the variables are the same, but the majority should be something other than what was demonstrated in the chapter, videos, and exercises. You will work on this data throughout the semester and submit your work to the course discussion board twice, once as a midterm project and once as a final project. 

* The data set you select must have the following characteristics:
    + An outcome variable that is binary or continuous 
    + A minimum of 3 variables of any data type to use to predict the outcome variable (predictors)

*The midterm project is worth 20% of your course grade and should include the following:*

* A link to the data set online or a copy of the original data file 
* A well-formatted R-Markdown file that:
    + Explains the research question 
        + What is the purpose of the research?
        + What is the outcome variable? 
        + What are the predictors? 
    + Describes the data set
        + When was it collected? 
        + How was it collected?
        + How many observations and variables are there? 
        + How were the outcome and predictors measured? (data type, categories, values)
    + Imports the data 
    + Cleans the data 
        + Recoding and labelling variables as needed 
        + Ensuring missing values are properly coded 
    + Includes and interprets appropriate descriptive statistics and/or graphs that clearly show the values of the outcome and predictor variables 
* A small percentage of your score will be based on your reviews of other student midterm discussion board posts
    
*The final project is worth 50% of your course grade and should include the following:*

* Everything from midterm with revisions based on the feedback you received 
* Additional text and code added to your R-Markdown file that: 
    + Includes any bivariate tests you conducted prior to building a model 
    + Explains the type of statistical model used and why it is appropriate for your research question and data set
        + The model *must* be linear regression or logistic regression 
    + The statistical model results  
    + Model fit 
    + Model significance 
    + Model assumption checking 
    + Interpretation of the assumption checking, statistical model results, fit, and significance
    + 1-2 paragraphs answering the research question based on your results, putting your results in the context of other research in the area (what do they confirm? what do they add?), and suggestions for future directions for research or practice 
* A small percentage of your score will be based on your reviews of other student final project discussion board posts

You MUST PASS the final project with a total of 70% or higher to pass the class. 

The midterm and final projects contribute to meeting the *Foundational knowledge* statement and cover all three *Foundational competencies* from section II.

**Participation and professionalism (5%)** 

Participating in team work and the class Discussion Board and/or zoom activities, providing feedback to the instructor and teaching assistant via course evaluations, and treating your fellow students, teaching assistants, and instructors (regular and guest) in a professional manner are required and will be translated into the professionalism score. Send an email with your mailing address to Dr. Harris (harrisj@wustl.edu) if you would like her to send you a class hex sticker through the mail :-).

## Week 15 (December 10): Final project videos & discussion board (plan to be available during class time this week)

BEFORE CLASS: 

* Post your project to the Final Project discussion board, include your Markdown file (or a link to it) and any other files needed to re-run the analyses. Adding a brief video (5-10 minutes) about your project is recommended **but not required**. 

DURING CLASS TIME: 

* For the first 90 minutes of class, review *at least* 3 projects of your choice posted on the Final Project thread on the discussion board by other students. You do not need to login to the course zoom to do this, just go directly to Canvas. As you review each project, pay attention to the topic, data source, analysis choices, visual displays of data, results, interpretation, and implications. 

* For each project you review, add something to the discussion board about the project. Keep in mind these are your colleagues who can greatly benefit from your thoughts, especially if they are **constructive** (a comment like "this is great!" or "this sucks!" is not very helpful, please be specific about what is great). Some things you could add:
    + A question about the project 
    + A compliment about something specific in the project 
    + A constructive criticism to help your colleague improve their project 
    + A response to another discussion board post about the same project  
    
* For the next 30 minutes of class: 
    + Review the discussion of your project and respond to at least 3 of the discussion points
    + Go back to discussions you contributed to and see how the discussion is unfolding, contribute if you have more to add 
    + Leave the Final Project discussion thread and read 2 of the Statistics in the Wild discussion posts from your classmates, add your thoughts to each one you read  
    
* (optional) For the last hour of the course: 
    + Check in on zoom with the course instructor and/or TA, who will be available in their zoom rooms. Please come by with any final questions, to wave awkwardly, to share thoughts about the course, to share funny memes, cool code, or bad graphs, or just to see the faces of your colleagues one more time before winter break. 
    + Note that multiple students may be in the zoom room at once, so feel free to use the chat and the instructor and teaching assistant will respond after class ends to any questions that go unanswered.

* (optional but highly recommended) Pat yourself on the back, you made it through Biostats! Congratulations! Have a restful break.

*NOTE: There may be minor revisions to this syllabus, usually to correct typos or errors. If a major change is needed to the structure of the course or the course requirements, students will be notified in advance. This is a very rare occurrence typically reserved for extreme situations.*
